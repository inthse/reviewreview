# Review Review
a (now nonfunctional) webpage for collecting all reviews from a story on fanfiction.net for saving, searching, or analysis

## Who is it for?
This is for me and other fanfiction writers who want a better way to access their reviews than the clunky interface on fanfiction.net, and to save them as text or json in case the story gets deleted or the site goes down.

## How is it used?
Unfortunately, it doesn't work anymore. So many web crawlers were stealing stories from fanfiction.net that they later added protection against bots. My relatively harmless little app can no longer even access the website, so it can't collect reviews anymore. I'm uploading it anyway so others can see the source code and potentially repurpose it.
